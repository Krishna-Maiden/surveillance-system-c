# Feature Implementation Gantt Timeline (Surveillance + Maintenance/IoT)

## Assumptions
- 6-person team (UX, React, C#, Python, QA, DevOps/PL)
- 1,600 hours/month total team capacity
- Phases and features can overlap (parallel work)
- Timeline is for full-feature, production-grade delivery

## High-Level Phases & Timeline

| Month | Major Activities / Milestones |
|-------|-------------------------------|
| 1     | Project kickoff, requirements, UX flows, architecture, DevOps setup |
| 2     | Core backend (C#), initial frontend (React), asset/work order models, IoT data pipeline (Python), basic UI, test infra |
| 3     | Video/AI/IoT integration, dashboards, inventory, notifications, mobile PWA, initial QA |
| 4     | Advanced analytics, reporting, compliance, security, integrations (ERP/CMMS), mobile offline, user/role mgmt |
| 5     | Backlog/advanced features (AI/ML, digital twin, AR, voice), performance/scalability, user feedback, documentation |
| 6     | Final QA, UAT, bugfix, deployment, training, go-live, post-launch support |

  - Months 2–3: Core UI, dashboards, asset/work order
  - Months 4–5: Mobile, reporting, advanced UI, accessibility
  - Month 6: Polish, bugfix

- **Python (AI/IoT):**
  - Months 2–3: IoT data pipeline, sensor integration
  - Months 3–5: AI/ML, anomaly detection, predictive, digital twin

- **QA/Testing:**
  - Months 2–6: Test case design, automation, regression, UAT

- **DevOps/PL:**
  - Month 1: CI/CD, infra, monitoring
  - Months 2–6: Deployment, scaling, security, release mgmt

## Notes
- Some features (e.g., DevOps, QA) run throughout the project.
- Advanced features and backlog items may extend the timeline if prioritized.
- Actual delivery may vary based on team velocity, blockers, and scope changes.
